description: Use this whenever setting up a new repo, configuring or changing CI, adding package scripts, or preparing a project for review/submission/portfolio use. Also use whenever the user mentions pnpm, monorepo setup, GitHub Actions, "clean up my repo," "make this reproducible," or is getting a project ready for a hackathon or a job application. Trigger this proactively at the start of any new project, not just when explicitly asked to set up tooling.

# Integration Quality & Dev Experience

The goal: a stranger (a judge, a reviewer, a future employer) can clone
this repo, run one install command and one test command, and see it
actually work — without secrets, without tribal knowledge, without CI
lying to them about what's actually verified.

## Package manager: pnpm

- Set `"packageManager": "pnpm@<version>"` in `package.json` — this pins
  the exact version so CI and every contributor use the same one.
- Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Delete any `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`
  left over from a previous setup — having two lockfiles is worse than
  having the "wrong" one, because tools disagree about which is authoritative.
- If this is a monorepo (an app + contracts + a shared client package,
  etc.), use a real `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `--filter` in scripts rather
  than duplicating dependencies across packages.
- Migrating an existing npm project: delete `node_modules` and
  `package-lock.json`, run `pnpm import` (converts the existing lockfile
  so versions don't drift), then `pnpm install`. See
  `references/pnpm-migration.md`.

## CI must run everything that matters

The most common gap: CI compiles and tests contracts (or backend logic)
but never runs `lint`, `typecheck`, or `build` on the app itself, even
though those scripts exist in `package.json`. That means the app can be
completely broken and CI stays green.

Every push and PR should run, at minimum:
```
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```
See `references/ci.yml` for a pnpm-based GitHub Actions template that runs
all four as separate jobs (so a lint failure doesn't hide a test failure
behind it) with dependency caching.

## Reproducibility without secrets

A reviewer should be able to `git clone`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, and
get a real pass/fail with zero API keys, zero funded wallets, zero network
calls to anything that costs money or requires an account. If part of your
test suite needs a live API key or a funded testnet wallet, that's a demo
script, not a test — name it accordingly (`live:demo`, `deploy:testnet`) so
it's obviously separate from what CI runs and what a cold reviewer can
verify themselves.

## Guardrails as code

A rule that only exists as a sentence in your README or CLAUDE.md will
eventually get violated by someone (including future-you, including an
agent) who didn't read it. Where you can, turn the rule into something
that actually fails when violated:
- An eslint rule or a grep-based CI step that fails the build if a secret
  env var is referenced outside its designated file.
- A test that asserts a specific function signature/permission set instead
  of just documenting "this should only be callable by X."
- A CI job that runs a static analyzer (`slither` for Solidity, `eslint`
  with `--max-warnings 0` for TS) instead of just recommending one in a doc.

## Docs that build trust instead of costing it

Two docs, cheap to write, disproportionately useful:
- `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` — what's explicitly not handled yet, stated
  plainly. Reviewers trust a project more when it names its own gaps than
  when they have to find them.
- `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` — a few paragraphs: who's trusted in this system,
  what happens if each key/wallet/role is compromised. See
  `references/THREAT_MODEL.template.md`.

Keep the README's setup instructions in sync with reality — after a pnpm
migration, grep the README for `npm install`/`npm run` and fix every
instance in the same PR, not later.

## Quick checklist before calling a repo "done"

- [ ] `packageManager` pinned, single lockfile committed, no leftover
      npm/yarn artifacts.
- [ ] CI runs lint, typecheck, build, and test as separate jobs on every
      push/PR — not just the contract/backend test suite.
- [ ] A cold `git clone && pnpm install && pnpm test` passes with zero
      secrets and zero network calls to paid/live services.
- [ ] Any live/demo/deploy script that needs real credentials is clearly
      named and separated from the default test path.
- [ ] `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` and `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` exist and match the
      current code, not an earlier version of it.
- [ ] README setup steps actually match the current scripts.
